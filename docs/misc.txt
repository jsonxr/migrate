MySQL Version Support:

Known Limitations
Does not support cross database foreign keys, routines, etc
Does not support character sets
Does not support column re-ordering

TINYINT(1) TINYINT(4) is the same.  The only thing that is affected is
when you use zerofill

5.5.3 - Supports PARAMETERS table
5.1.41 - Supports ?

Assumptions that are made on a reverse:
tinyint(1) is a boolean.  (it could be an int... with display width of 1 instead)
varchar(255) is a string with length of 255 (default string)
mysql before 5.0.3 varchar max length is 255
5.0.3 and later varchar max is 65535
